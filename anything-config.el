;; To configure anything you should setup `anything-sources'
;; with specify source, like below:
;;
;; (setq anything-sources
;;       (list anything-c-source-buffers

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put `anything.el' (at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/anything.el)
;; and `anything-config.el' to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'anything-config)
;;

;;; Customize:
;;
;; `anything-c-use-standard-keys'
;; If non-nil the keybindings of anything will be the standard
;; bindings used in most parts of emacs, e.g. M-p/M-n for minibuffer
;; history, C-s for isearch, etc.
;;
;; `anything-c-adaptive-history-file'
;; Path of file where history information is stored.
;;
;; `anything-c-adaptive-history-length'
;; Maximum number of candidates stored for a source.
;;
;; `anything-c-google-suggest-url'
;; URL used for looking up suggestions.
;;
;; `anything-c-google-suggest-search-url'
;; URL used for searching.
;;
;; All of the above can customize by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET anything-config RET
;;

;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2009/02/16
;;   * Andy Stewart:
;;      * Fix the bug of `anything-c-source-imenu'.
;;      * Clean up code.
